# Brief / Scope of Project
Create a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

### MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag

# What I did
I designed and implemented a website which allows the user to add, remove, view and edit transactions, which can be grouped and summarised by category and month.

# Tools I used
Back end: SQL (psql)
Connect using: pg gem
Logic: Ruby
Connect using: sinatra gem / .erb files
Front end: HTML / CSS

# Result
A working money cashboard website!
